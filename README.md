# GeneOS ðŸ§¬
A repository for object-oriented rene regulation exploration. It is meant to demonstrate the core concept of the genome as a data store used in the processes of life, in order to ultimately elucidate the human gene regulatory code.

Some fundamental assertions I make:
* A gene is simply a stored database entry for a protein that is used by life.
* If a gene is exposed to its environment, it will get expressed (due to the ubiquity of ribosomes).
* "On" and "Off" are simplifications of the state of being exposed vs. hidden due to either methylation or spatial orientation, in conjunction with one ore more transcription factors, which may themselves be other genes.
* These patterns are inherited and conserved across members of the species.
